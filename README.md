# oh-my-zsh-better-robbyrussell

A modernized twist on the default **robbyrussell** theme for [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).  
It keeps the simplicity of the original theme while adding **AWS profile awareness** and a **clean Git branch indicator** (with optional truncation).

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ AWS profile indicator (in yellow, hidden if using `default`)
- ✅ Git branch display (optional truncation, disabled by default)
- ✅ Directory name display (optional truncation, disabled by default)
- ✅ Minimal look inspired by `robbyrussell`
- ✅ Green arrow if last command succeeded, red arrow if it failed
- ✅ Current directory in cyan

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ymulenll/oh-my-zsh-better-robbyrussell/main/better-robbyrussell.zsh-theme -o $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/better-robbyrussell.zsh-theme
```

Then edit your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="better-robbyrussell"
plugins=(git aws)  # required
```

Reload with:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## ⚠️ Requirements

This theme **requires** the following Oh My Zsh plugins to function properly:

- [`git`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git)  
- [`aws`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/aws)  

Make sure they’re listed in your `plugins=(...)` inside `~/.zshrc`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Truncation is **disabled by default**. To enable truncation, add these variables to your `~/.zshrc`:

**Git branch truncation:**
```zsh
TRUNCATED_BRANCH_NAME_LENGTH=10
```
(Only truncates if this variable is set)

**Git branch start word:**
```zsh
TRUNCATED_BRANCH_NAME_START_WITH="CR-"
```
Extract branch name starting from a specific word/prefix. For example, with `TRUNCATED_BRANCH_NAME_START_WITH="CR-"` and `TRUNCATED_BRANCH_NAME_LENGTH=7`, a branch like `bugfix/CR-7777-fix-bug` will display as `CR-7777`.

**Directory name truncation:**
```zsh
TRUNCATED_DIR_NAME_LENGTH=15
```
(Only truncates if this variable is set)

> 💡 **Tip**: The theme automatically adapts to your environment - AWS profiles only show when not using `default`. Truncation is optional and can be enabled by setting `TRUNCATED_BRANCH_NAME_LENGTH` and/or `TRUNCATED_DIR_NAME_LENGTH` in your `~/.zshrc`.
